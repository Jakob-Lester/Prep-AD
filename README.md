<h1>Preparing Active Directory Infrastructure in Azure</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I create two VMs (Virtual Machines), one running Windows Server, to act as a Domain Controller. The other VM will act as a client, running Windows 10 that will join the domain. In later projects I will deploy AD, run a script that will create users in the domain, which I can log into from the client VM, then manage the accounts and update the group policies, all to simulate a real life IT environment!  <br/>
